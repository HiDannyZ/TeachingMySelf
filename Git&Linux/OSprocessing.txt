Apprendix for commands in Linux that deal with OS processing measurement.

Purpose: These commands are used to measure the usage of address spacing


cd /proc
	- /proc is a process information psudo-file system (virtual filesystem).
	- It doesn't contain "real" files, but runtime system information like system memory and hardware configuration

pgrep programName  or ps -ef | grep programName
	- Both Gives Process ID
	- pgrep gives directly the process ID
	- ps -ef | grep programName gives all the processes IDs that have programName in their name

cat /proc/pid/smaps
	- This file shows memory consumpation for each of the process's mappings
	- Gives a description of the current memory allocation to each segment of the process address space
	- Smaps stands for shared maps

cat /proc/pid/map
	- Gives address limits of the stack and heap

size fileName.c
	- Finds the size of the Complied code also known as its executable(including its code vs. data segements)

pmap PID
	- To see memory allocated to each section of the process
	- Als contains the total size of the code during run time at the bottom

strace programName
	- Records all system calls invoked while executing the program given
