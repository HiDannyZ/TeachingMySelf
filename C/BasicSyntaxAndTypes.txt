C doesn't have Strings, so we have to use character arrays instead.


Types for String Printing:
	-



#include <stdio.h>
	- Allows us to utilize print statements

printf("Words I want to Say \n");
	- Print Statement
	- Use \n to go to next line for future statements

Example Code:

if (x < y){
	char
	printf("Something\n")	
}
else{
	printf("Else\n")
}
