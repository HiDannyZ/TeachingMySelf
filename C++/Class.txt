Classes is used to group a series of similar functions.
Objects are instances of Classes, which allow us to use the functions in the class.

** Remember to avoid having class variables in Public specficer. Its a bad coding practice. Make them private instead


Class NameOfClass{};
	- initializes a class 

public:
	- Goes under initalization of class and is a access specficer
	- This allows us to use the functions under this anywhere outside the class.


NameOfClass NameOfObject;
	- Creates an Object, which allows us to access the items in a class
		
NameOfObject.publicfunction()
	- Allows us to access and use the functions in class

NameOfObject.variable
	- allows us to access and set class variable.
	- This method is not prefered..
	- We should use a function to set variable.



Example Code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Dog{
	public:					// Access Specificer
		int x;				// AVOID DOING A Class variable in public tho
		void CoolSaying(){
			cout << "woof";
		}
}

int main(){
	Dog DogObject;
	DogObject.CoolSaying();
	return 0;
}
