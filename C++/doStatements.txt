Do while Loop: 

Not really utilized in Programming

Ensures the code runs at least one time before doing the while loop.

Essentially, the contents in the do statement will run at least once. Then, it will go into the while statement and run the do statement until while loop breaks.


Example Code:

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namescape std;

int main(){

	int x = 1;

	do{
		std::cout << x << std::endl;
		x++;
	}while(x<10);

}
