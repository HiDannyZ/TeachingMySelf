Switch and case statements are pretty simple to understand. 
The usage of this can be replaced with if-else statements, which is much more standard too.


	break
		- means to end the switch
		- needed because there's no need to go through the switch anymore once you find your case

	default:
		- do this if none of the cases are met


//Example Code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	
	int age = 21;

	switch(age){
		case 16:
			cout<< "If age is equal to 16"
			break;
		case 18: 
			cout<< " If age is equal to 18"
			break;
		case 21:
			cout << " I can drink alcohol!! 6 more months for me zzzzzzzzz"
			break;
		default:
			cout << " If all the above values failed, print this!"
	}
}
